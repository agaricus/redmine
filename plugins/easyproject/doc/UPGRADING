Same as Redmine 2.4.2. See [redmine_root]/doc/UPGRADING

Installing Redmine and Easy Redmine to virtual directory like http://localhost/redmine is not working.

== Upgrading to latest Easy Redmine from a package

1. Backup your Redmine database and file system folder if something make wrong. Do not make backup into [redmine] directory! You have to copy it outside!

2. Delete all Redmine files and folders WITHOUT:
    - [redmine_root]/config/database.yml
    - [redmine_root]/config/configuration.yml
    - [redmine_root]/files/*
    - your additional plugins or modifications

3. Copy all content from a package into [redmine_root]

4. More gems are required. Under [redmine_root] directory run:
     bundle update

5. Under [redmine_root] directory run (if you are using bitnami write 'sudo' before 'bundle'):
     bundle exec rake easyproject:install RAILS_ENV=production

6. Start your Redmine application server. E.g. under [redmine_root] directory run:
     bundle exec ruby script/rails server -e production
