h2. Known issues:

* maximum attachment size is checked against BASE64 encoded image data (even
  smaller images than the maximum allowed attachment size can be rejected)
* clipboard_image_paste's 'Add picture from clipboard' command combines number
  of both regular files and pasted images for maximum number of attachment check,
  while Redmine's original 'Add another file' counts only regular files
